This a currency exchanger application that uses data from exchangeratesapi.io to convert between currencies.

The project was made using create-react-app and react-redux.

It was developed as a requirement for an interview test.

Special credit to exchangeratesapi.io for letting me use their api-resource. Also, to freepik for providing the free flat illustration that was used in this work.
